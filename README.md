# Hunter Mayer Homework Challenge 3

## Description
In this assignment I wrote the JavaScript needed for a password generator using prompts and confirms that the user inputs. I primarily used what I learned of if statements and for loops in order to create a function that would take in the inputs from the user to generate a password of varying lengths, lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters. 

### Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
